38.Every 10 pixels until x is larger than 390 pixels. 
What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
The first 10 is the left margin. The second 10 is the limitaiton of the loop (when x < 390, the loop will kepp going) and also the second 10 can be recognized as the right margin. The third 10 is 10 pixels.
How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
6 times.
What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?
The first way is to reduce the rings themselves. The second way is to increase the increment number.
How can you make the ellipse trail longer?
Keep more value for the x and y.
